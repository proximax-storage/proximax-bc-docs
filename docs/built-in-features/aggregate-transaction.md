title: Aggregate Transaction
---
Aggregated Transactions merge multiple transactions into one, allowing **trustless swaps**, and other advanced logic. Sirius Chain does this by generating a one-time disposable smart contract. When all involved [accounts][Account] have cosigned the aggregate transaction, all the inner transactions are executed simultaneously.
 
## Examples of Aggregate Transacitons
## Sending payouts

Dan announces an aggregate transaction that merges two transfer transactions.

As he is the only required signed, we say the aggregate transaction it is complete. After announcing it to the network, Alice and Bob will receive the mosaics at the same time.

## Example of Multi-Asset Escrowed Transactions

Alice buys tickets. When the ticket distributor co-signs the aggregate transaction, the swap will happen atomically.

## Example of Paying For Others Fees

Alice sends ten dollars to Bob using an app that makes payments. But she doesnâ€™t have any XPX tokens to pay the blockchain transaction fee.

By creating an aggregate bonded transaction, Alice can convert USD to XPX to pay the fee. Now, Alice and Bob can use Sirius Chain without ever having to buy or hold XPX.

Since the app creator can put their own branding on the open source payment app, Alice and Bob may not even know they are using blockchain.

## Aggregate Complete

The aggregate transaction is **complete** when all co-signers have signed it.

Once it has all the required signatures, one of those who signed can announce it to the network. If the setup of the inner transaction setup is valid, and there is no validation error, the transactions will be executed at the same time.

Aggregate complete transactions enable more transactions to be added per block by gathering multiple inner transactions between different participants in the same operation.

## Aggregate Bonded

An aggregate transaction is **bonded** when it requires signatures from other participants.

<div class=info>

**Note:**

When sending an **aggregate bonded transaction**, an account must first announce and confirm a [hash lock transaction](#hashlocktransaction) for this aggregate with at least `10` XPX.

</div>

Once an aggregate bonded is announced, it reaches partial state and notifies its status through WebSockets or HTTP API calls.

Every time a cosignatory signs the transaction and [announces an aggregate bonded cosignature](#cosignature), the network checks if all the required cosigners have already signed. In this situation, the transaction changes to an unconfirmed state until the network accepts it, and it is included in a block once processed.

### AggregateTransaction

**Version**: 0x02

**Entity type**: 0x4141 ([complete](#aggregate-complete)), 0x4241 ([bonded](#aggregate-bonded))

**Inlines**:

- [Transaction][Transaction]

**Property** |	**Type** |	**Description**
-------------|-----------|--------------------
payloadSize |	uint8 |	The transaction payload size in bytes. In other words, the total number of bytes was occupied by all inner transactions.
transactions |	array(byte, payloadSize) |	The array of transactions initiated by different accounts. An aggregate transaction can contain up to `1000` inner transactions involving up to `15` different cosignatories. Other aggregate transactions are not allowed as inner transactions.
cosignatures |	array(byte, size - payloadSize) |	An array of transaction [cosignatures](#detachedcosignature).

### DetachedCosignature

Cosignature transactions are used to sign [announced aggregate bonded transactions](#examples) with missing cosignatures.

**Inlines**:

- [Cosignature](#cosignature)

**Property** |	**Type** |	**Description**
-------------|-----------|--------------------
parentHash |	32 bytes (binary) |	The aggregate bonded transaction hash to cosign.

### Cosignature

- [Transaction][Transaction] or [EmbeddedTransaction][EmbeddedTransaction]

**Property** |	**Type** |	**Description**
-------------|-----------|--------------------
signer |	32 bytes (binary) |	The cosigner public key.
signature |	64 bytes (binary) |	The transaction signature.

### HashLockTransaction

**Alias**: LockFundsTransaction

Announce a hash lock transaction before sending a signed [aggregate bonded transaction](#examples). This mechanism is required to prevent network spamming.

Once the related aggregate bonded transaction is confirmed, locked funds become available again in the account that signed the initial hash lock transaction.

If the aggregate bonded transaction duration is reached without being signed by all cosignatories, the locked amount is collected by the block Validator at the height where the lock expires.

**Version**: 0x01

**Entity type**: 0x4148

**Inlines**:

- [Transaction][Transaction] or [EmbeddedTransaction][EmbeddedTransaction]

**Property** |	**Type** |	**Description**
-------------|-----------|--------------------
mosaic |	[Mosaic][Mosaic#mosaic] |	Locked mosaic, must be at least `10 prx:xpx`.
duration |	uint64 |	The lock duration.
hash |	32 bytes (binary) |	The aggregate bonded transaction hash that has to be confirmed before unlocking the mosaics.
