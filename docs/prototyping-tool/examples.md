## Contributing

We love to receiving contributions from our community â€” you! Follow these guidelines to get your flow included in this documentation.

The first step is to export the flow you have created. In Node-RED, select the flow you want to export. Open `Export > Clipboard` from the menu (Ctrl-E) and copy the JSON from the dialogue.

We are using [Node RED flows repository](https://flows.nodered.org/?term=nem2&type=flow&num_pages=1) to share our flows.

1. Click `Add flow`.
2. Give your flow a short, descriptive title and describe what the flow does and how it is used.
3. Paste the JSON flow you want to share.
4. Add the tag `NEM2`.

After a while, your flow and your GitHub username will be included in this page.
