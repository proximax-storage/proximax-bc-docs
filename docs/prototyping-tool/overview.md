Create blockchain applications without coding using **NEM2 Prototyping Tool**.

Drag & drop NEM nodes and link them with other services in new and interesting ways for prototyping or learning purposes.

## Node-RED

[NEM2 Prototyping Tool](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-prototyping-tool) is a collection of **Node-RED** nodes.

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a visual programming tool to wire together hardware devices, APIs and online services.

It provides a browser-based editor to wire nodes. The combination of nodes is named flows, which you can execute in a single click.

The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON, being exportable to share with others.

## Installation

Download and run the [executable package](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-prototyping-tool/releases/tag/v0.10.0) for **Windows**, **Linux** or **Mac**.

Do you already have Node-RED app? Open `Manage palette` and install [node-red-contrib-nem2](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-nem2) package.
