The ProximaX Sirius Chain Developer Center is an open source project. There are many ways you can contribute, such as  writing guides, improving the documentation, and notiyfing us of submitting errors and requests.

## Error reports

When you have found an error in the Sirius Chain Developer Center, first check that you are using the latest version of the developer center.

 If not, search the errors in our issues list on GitHub in case a similar [issue](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/issues) has already been opened.

It would be very helpful if you could prepare a reproduction of the error. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it.

Please, consider the followin the template to report your issue:

>  **Error description** <br>
> A short sentence explaining what is wrong.<br>
>
> **URL or Screenshot** <br>
> For faster issue detection, we would need to know where to find it.

Provide as much information as you can.

Open a new [issue](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/issues) here.

## Requests

If you find yourself wishing for content that does not exist in the ProximaX Sirius Chain Developer Center, you are probably not alone. Most of the documentation and guides as today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an [issue](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/issues) on our issues list on GitHub which depicts the missing documentation or improvement you would like to see.

If the improvement is not related to documentation, but with a specific project, please check CONTRIBUTING.md in the project repository.

## Contributing code and documentation changes

To expand and improve the ProximaX Sirius Chain Developer Center, please find or open an [issue](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/issues) about it first. Discuss what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

We enjoy working with contributors to get their pull-requests accepted.

## Contributing License Notice

When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.

## Fork and clone the repository

If the documentation change is small, you can use the “Edit on Github” button at the top of the page.

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes

 > Run `make live html` and preview your changes.

2. Submit a pull request

  >  Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
