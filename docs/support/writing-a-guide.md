Thank you for considering writing a new guide!

## Before starting

1. Open the [proximax-bc-docs repository issues](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/issues), and find some ideas pending to be written. They have the label “great new issue”.
2. Opt to contribute to one of them by adding a comment, or create a new issue with your guide idea.
3. Check if you can classify your guide under one of the current categories. If not, create a new issue proposing a new category:

**Categories** 

**Built-in feature** |	**Tags**
---------------------|-------------
Account |	account, multisig-account, mlma
Blockchain |	blockchain
Namespace |	namespace
Mosaic |	mosaic
Transaction |	transfer-transaction, aggregate-transaction, cross-chain-transaction, monitoring
Node |	transfer-transaction, aggregate-transaction, cross-chain-transaction, monitoring

4. You can opt to write the guide for this repository, or use your blog.

## Write a guide for this repository

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and clone the [proximax-bc-docs](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs) repository.

```
$> git clone <url>
```

2. Make sure you have Python 2.7 or 3.4+ and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed.

```
$> python --version
```

3. Install requirements using pip:
```
$> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a new `rst` file inside one of the guides folder,
```
$> mkdir source/guides/<folder_name>/<title>.rst
```
5. Use the following template to organize your content.

    
    :orphan:

    .. post:: 18 Aug, 2018
        :category: monitoring
        :excerpt: 1
        :nocomments:
        :author: <your_name_or_username>

    Explain necessary concepts before starting to code.

    *************
    Prerequisites

    - A
    - B
    - C

    ************************
    Let’s get into some code
    ************************

    Present the code and step-by-step explanation.

    ************
    What's next?
    ************

    Is there any extra exercise that readers could try on their own?

6. Write and code your guide! Check the [restructured text cheatsheet](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst) to style your text.

7. Add the [code examples](https://github.com/proximax-storage/proximax-bc-docs/tree/master/source/resources/examples) under `source/resources/examples/<language_or_tool>`. You can render fragments of code from a file inside your rst file.

    .. example-code::

        .. literalinclude:: <relative_url>.ts
            :language: typescript
            :lines: 20-40

7. Test and preview your changes.

    >   $> make livehtml

8. Push your changes and do a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). The repository maintainers will proofread and edit the content to follow the documentation writing style.

## Write a guide in your blog

Create or comment an existent issue including the link of your blog post. If the content is relevant and not repeated, the repository maintainers will include your link under the guides section.
