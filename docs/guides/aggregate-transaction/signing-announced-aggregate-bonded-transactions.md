This guide will show you how to cosign aggregate bonded transactions that require your accountâ€™s cosignature.

This guide will show you how to cosign aggregate bonded transactions that require being signed by your account.

## Prerequisites

- Finish [creating an escrow with aggregate bonded transaction guide](./creating-an-escrow-with-aggregate-bonded-transaction.md)
- Have received an aggregate bounded transaction
- XPX-Chain-SDK
- A text editor or IDE
- Have on account with `xpx`

## Getting into some code

You have announced an [aggregate bonded transaction](../../built-in-features/aggregate-transaction.md), but all required cosigners have not signed it yet.

1. Create a function to cosign any aggregate bonded transaction.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Golang-->
```go
func cosignAggregateBoundedTransaction(signedAggregateBoundedTransaction *sdk.SignedTransaction, account *sdk.Account) *sdk.CosignatureSignedTransaction {
    cosignatureTransaction := sdk.NewCosignatureTransactionFromHash(signedAggregateBoundedTransaction.Hash)
    signedCosignatureTransaction , err := account.SignCosignatureTransaction(cosignatureTransaction)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    return signedCosignatureTransaction
}
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

2. Fetch all aggregate bonded transactions pending to be signed by your account.

<div class=info>

**Note**

To fetch aggregate bonded transactions that must be signed by multisig cosignatories, refer to the multisig public key instead. See [how to get multisig accounts where an account is cosignatory](../multisig-account/converting-an-account-to-multisig.md#guide-get-multisig-account-info).

</div>

3. For each transaction, check if you have not already signed it. Cosign each pending transaction using the previously created function.

4. Announce `CosignatureSignedTransaction` to the network.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Golang-->
```go
_, err = client.Transaction.AnnounceAggregateBoundedCosignature(context.Background(), cosignatureSignedTransaction)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
