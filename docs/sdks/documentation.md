SDKs need to be adopted by other developers. As a contributor, no one knows better than you how a determined SDK works. Consider helping others and spread the usage of the SDK by providing the following documentation.

## Readme

Check if your repository has a complete README. Consider adapting the <a href="/downloads/README_SDK.md" >here</a> template used by some SDKs.

Required sections:

- Requirements
- Installation
- Contributing
- License

## Comments and reference docs

Document functions and classes with comments while you write your code. A reference generator should be able to read this comments and generate HTML as an output.

Some examples of reference generators are [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) for GO, whereas in Java we are using [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javadoc-137458.html). Research which is the reference generator most convenient for your language.

## Guides

The ProximaX Sirius-Chain Developer Center gathers a collection of [guides](../guides/overview.md). They show developers how to use Sirius-Chain built-in features while following step-by-step use cases.

Each guide comes with at least one snippet. Snippets are executable pieces of code that solve the proposed use case.
