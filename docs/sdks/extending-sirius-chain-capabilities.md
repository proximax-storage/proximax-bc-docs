title: Extending Sirius-Chain Capabilities
---
Aside from creating a heavy and full-featured [SDK](./overview.md), we are developing a robust and lightweight one. Thanks to this SDK, different libraries can be developed for each standard, on top of XPX-Chain-SDK, allowing higher and faster growth for Sirius-Chain applications.

Developers could opt to create a standalone library to add more features into our SDK. However, to become an accepted library, it should be proposed.
